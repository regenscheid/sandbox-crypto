# MCP connectors and authentication

Date: 2026-10-10. Proposed (D64, D66, D67). The user's requirements:

- crypto-research-mcp is the phase 1 connector; others are added later.
- MCP services authenticate mainly with OAuth.
- `Authorization` and custom-header authentication should also be supported.
- A secrets manager should keep raw credentials away from agents.

Sources: the [MCP authorization specification, 2025-11-25](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/docs/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization.mdx) and the OpenShell v0.1.3 [providers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/blob/v0.1.3/docs/how-it-works/providers/overview.mdx) and [profiles](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/blob/v0.1.3/docs/how-it-works/providers/profiles.mdx) documentation. Nothing here has been tested.

## Goals

1. **No agent-reachable process holds a raw MCP credential.** That covers the harness, delegated agents and research workers.
2. **Workers never connect to MCP services directly** (user requirement). All MCP traffic, from the orchestrator and from workers, goes through one MCP proxy, which applies each project's policy.
3. **One registry for all servers.** Each server is a `mcp.servers` entry in the project policy plus an OpenShell provider. There are no server-specific code paths, so adding a server later is configuration.
4. **The same tool-level policy applies to every caller,** with an optional narrower toolset for worker code than for agents.

## Components

| Component | Zone | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connector auth service | Z1 (trusted) | Runs the interactive OAuth flow with the user, registers clients, stores tokens in OpenShell providers, and performs refreshes when the gateway cannot (below). Python, MIT, built on the MCP Python SDK's OAuth client support where it fits |
| **MCP proxy** | Runs **inside its own OpenShell sandbox** | The only MCP endpoint that the orchestrator and workers can reach. It authenticates each caller, applies the project's tool policy, and forwards to remote MCP servers through the OpenShell proxy, which injects credentials and enforces `protocol: mcp` rules again on the way out. It holds only placeholders |
| OpenShell gateway and providers | Z1 | Credential storage (encrypted database, Kubernetes Secrets or OpenBao), placeholder resolution, gateway-managed refresh where possible |
| Harness MCP client and worker MCP clients | Z2 / Z3 | Talk only to the MCP proxy; their configuration contains no secrets |

## MCP proxy

**Reachability.** Worker sandbox policy allows the MCP proxy endpoint and no MCP server hosts. Worker sandboxes carry no MCP providers. A worker that tries to reach an MCP server directly is denied by the hard floor, because MCP server hosts are listed as proxy-only.

**Caller identity.** Each caller presents a short-lived proxy credential that the worker service or orchestrator issues per session or execution. In worker sandboxes it is itself an OpenShell placeholder, bound to the proxy endpoint. The proxy maps it to project, session, execution and caller kind (agent or worker code). Every MCP call is attributed in the event log with that context, which also closes the monitor attribution gap for shared project containers.

**Policy.** The proxy evaluates the project's `mcp.servers` tool rules (`allow`/`escalate`/`deny`, most restrictive wins) before forwarding. `escalate` creates a durable permission request through the shared workflow, with the policy's timeout and deny fallback. The outbound OpenShell `protocol: mcp` rules repeat the allow/deny lists, as defense in depth.

**Other duties:**

- Rate and spend limits per project and server (for credit-consuming tools such as crawlers).
- Response size limits. Large or binary results (PDFs, images) become artifact references in project storage instead of base64 in model context, as the external skill pack requires.
- Uniform handling of `403 insufficient_scope` (escalation, not automatic re-consent).
- One audit stream of requests and responses for the contextual monitor.

**Implementation.** Write a thin proxy in Python on the MCP Python SDK (MIT), since the policy and attribution semantics are project-specific. Existing permissively licensed proxies are references or possible bases: sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy (MIT), IBM mcp-context-forge (Apache-2.0) and docker/mcp-gateway (MIT). Evaluate their transport and auth handling before writing from scratch.

**Placement.** One proxy per deployment, policy-scoped per project, is enough for phase 1 on babbage. On the cluster it runs as a separate sandboxed deployment near the workers.

The alternative of running the orchestrator itself as an OpenShell sandbox (D47) remains worth evaluating. The proxy is needed either way, so that workers stay off MCP services.

## Authentication modes

Each server entry declares one mode:

| Mode | Use | How credentials reach the request |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oauth` (primary) | Servers that follow MCP authorization | The access token is stored as an OpenShell provider credential with `auth_style: bearer`. The MCP proxy sends `Authorization: Bearer <placeholder>`, and the OpenShell proxy substitutes the real token on every request (the spec requires the header on every request and forbids tokens in query strings) |
| `bearer` | Static API tokens | Provider credential; `Authorization: Bearer <placeholder>` |
| `headers` | Custom header schemes (`X-Api-Key`, `Authorization: Basic …`, several headers) | One provider credential per secret value. Header values in the server entry reference them, and the MCP proxy places the placeholders. OpenShell resolves placeholders in any header value, including Basic auth. The roadmap's "profile-driven placement" is not needed, because the MCP proxy places the placeholder |
| `none` | Public servers | No credential |

## OAuth flow (MCP 2025-11-25)

The connector auth service performs the client side of MCP authorization when the user clicks **Connect** in the GUI:

1. **Discovery.** Call the server unauthenticated, read the `WWW-Authenticate` resource-metadata URL (or fall back to the well-known paths), fetch the protected-resource metadata (RFC 9728), then the authorization-server metadata (RFC 8414 / OpenID discovery).
2. **Client registration**, in the order the spec prefers:
   - *Client ID Metadata Document*: needs an HTTPS-hosted metadata document. Practical once there is a hosted endpoint.
   - *Pre-registration*: a configured `client_id` and secret.
   - *Dynamic Client Registration* (RFC 7591): the fallback, likely the first choice on babbage.
3. **Authorization code with PKCE.** Include the `resource` parameter set to the server's canonical URI (RFC 8707) and the policy's scopes. Use a `localhost` redirect on babbage. Hosted deployments use an HTTPS callback, which the spec requires for non-localhost redirects.
4. **Token exchange**, again with `resource`.
5. **Storage.** The access token becomes the provider's injectable credential, with its expiry. The refresh token, `client_id` and any client secret become secret refresh material. The token endpoint goes into a per-server provider profile; OpenShell keeps token URLs profile-owned.

**Refresh.** There are two options, and the spike decides between them per server:

- *Gateway-managed* (`oauth2_refresh_token`). OpenShell refreshes the token and stores rotated refresh tokens automatically. Its documented refresh configuration has a token URL and scopes, but **no `resource` parameter**, which the MCP spec requires on every token request. This works only if the authorization server accepts refreshes without `resource`.
- *External* (`external` strategy). The connector auth service refreshes with `resource` and pushes the new access token to the provider through the OpenShell API. Refresh material then lives in the connector auth service's secret storage (Kubernetes Secrets/OpenBao, or the gateway's store if the API allows).

**Scope changes.** If a server answers `403 insufficient_scope`, the proxy does not re-authorize on its own. It raises a permission escalation naming the scopes requested. The user re-consents through the connector auth service. This keeps step-up authorization a human decision.

**Token audience.** Because tokens are audience-bound to one MCP server (RFC 8707) and the OpenShell provider is endpoint-bound to the same host, a token cannot be replayed at another service even inside the proxy.

## Server entry (policy file)

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    crypto-research-mcp:
      url: https://…/mcp                 # canonical URI, used as the OAuth resource
      revision: "2025-11-25"             # MCP protocol revisions allowed
      auth:
        mode: oauth
        registration: dcr                # cimd | preregistered | dcr
        scopes: [read]                   # least privilege; server-specific names
        refresh: gateway                 # gateway | external
      tools: { allow: [...], escalate: [...], deny: [...] }

    example-header-server:               # later phase
      url: https://…/mcp
      auth:
        mode: headers
        headers:
          X-Api-Key: "${provider:example-header-server.API_KEY}"
          X-Account: "research"           # non-secret literal
```

`${provider:NAME.KEY}` references resolve to OpenShell placeholders, never to secret values. A literal secret in a header value is rejected by the policy compiler.

## Later phases

- **Local stdio MCP servers** run inside a worker sandbox, with their own providers and egress policy. They are never spawned beside the orchestrator.
- **More remote servers** need only a policy entry and a **Connect** click (OAuth), or a provider created from a token (bearer/headers).
- **Per-project token separation.** The same service connected for two projects can use two providers, so revoking one project's access does not affect the other.

## Checks for the spike

| Check | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| OAuth connect to crypto-research-mcp | Discovery, registration, PKCE and `resource` parameter recorded; tokens stored only in the provider/credential driver |
| Placeholder injection | The proxy and sandbox environment hold placeholders only; requests reach the server with a valid bearer token |
| Refresh | Gateway-managed refresh succeeds, or a server rejection without `resource` is observed and external refresh succeeds; rotated refresh tokens persist |
| Custom headers | A fixture server requiring `X-Api-Key` and one requiring Basic auth both accept placeholder-injected values; the unbound host gets `credential_endpoint_mismatch` |
| Tool policy | Allowed, escalated and denied tools behave as configured for calls from the orchestrator and from a worker, both through the proxy |
| No direct worker access | A worker request to the MCP server host is denied; the worker environment contains no MCP placeholders |
| Attribution | Two sessions in one project container call the same tool; events identify each session and execution |
| Binary results | A PDF resource returned through the proxy becomes an artifact reference, not inline base64 |
| Step-up | A `403 insufficient_scope` becomes a permission request, not an automatic re-authorization |
| Revocation | Disconnecting a server removes the provider; later calls fail closed |
